# Data Job Market Dashboards

This repository showcases two distinct Power BI projects, each providing a unique analysis of the data job market using a dataset of nearly 480,000 job postings from 2024. Both dashboards are designed to empower job seekers and recruiters with actionable insights.

# Featured Dashboards  
Each dashboard has its own dedicated README with more details on the build process and specific features.

This modern, single-page dashboard features a unique dual-metric analysis, allowing users to toggle charts to view top skills and jobs by either market demand (Job Count) or compensation (Median Yearly Salary). It serves as a strategic tool for job seekers to identify skill gaps and for recruiters to benchmark salaries and validate job descriptions.
